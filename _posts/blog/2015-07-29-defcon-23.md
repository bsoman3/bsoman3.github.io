I am excited to be going to Defcon this year. It will be fun to meet all my infosec friends. I am also looking forward to attending some sessions this year (instead of spending all my time at the lock picking village). I found 4 major buckets of talks that I think will be interesting. 

###Malware (with or without Data Analytics)
I'm really interested in Malware analysis particularly using big-data analytics, or classifiers. These are talks related to that. The NLP talk is not strictly related to malware, but I would like to see how this researcher used the techniques and am curious to see if some of those constructs are portable to classification of Malware.

###Potential projects for rainy days
These are fun projects for rainy days @ PDX that I want to contentedly spend in the hackerspace.

###Areas that are new-ish to me 
These are areas that I am somewhat familiar with but maybe need to dive in more methodically.
